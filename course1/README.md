# Subject

## 1) data science 101

Play with the notebook datasciences101.ipynb, play with the data to learn as much as possible it will useful for the next TPs / courses


## 2) Implement a connect4 solver

In this TP you are going to make your own implementation of connect4 solver

You only need to modify the file p4/ai.py (you can have a look at the rest of the code) and the code can be launched with the command: `python3 p4/game.py`

Follow the details in the code and:

- Implement a naive model playing connect4

- Implement Minimax solver

- Implement Alphabeta solver


## 3) Implement A star pathfinder algorithm

You have to, modify the `a_star/a_star.py` file:

- Implement your own graph data structure (with a function to create a graph)

- Implement your own test set (graph examples to test your algorithm)

- Implement the A* algorithm

- Plot the graph with the path selected by your algorithm (https://plotly.com/python/network-graphs/)
