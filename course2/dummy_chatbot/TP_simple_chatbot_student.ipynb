    "### Refining the Chatbot Functionality for FAQ Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance our school's FAQ chatbot, we'll focus on fine-tuning **keyword rules**. These rules are crucial for matching user inquiries with precise answers from our FAQ list by recognizing essential terms related to queries about \"enrollment,\" \"school hours,\" and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are improved guidelines for creating a more responsive and intelligent chatbot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop a comprehensive keyword dictionary**: Populate a dictionary mapping significant keywords to corresponding FAQ queries. Prioritize inclusivity in your keywords to cover variations in user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Craft a smart matching function**: Create a function `get_best_matching_question` that go through the user's input to find keywords and identifies the most relevant question.\\\n",
    "Consider how to refine the function so it accurately identifies the closest match, especially when dealing with multiple similar keywords, to significantly improve the precision of the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement an effective answer retrieval function**: Design a function that utilizes the outcome of the matching process (`get_best_matching_question`() ) to fetch and deliver the correct answer from the FAQ list to the user.\n"
